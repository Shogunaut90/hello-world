# hello-world

Hello, I am AJ, I am an aspiring Web Developer currently focusing on Vanilla Javascript. Right now though, I am learning to use Github.
From what I understand it's a pretty powerful sytem to edit and control versions of your project. 
It also allows other people to make edits to your project, so you can have several people ANYWHERE around the world working on the SAME project at once! 
Pretty Awesome! After I get comfortable with JS, I'm moving on to a framwework.
